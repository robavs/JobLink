# JobLink

JobLink is a platform designed for job posting and recruitment purposes specifically for the field of Software Engineering. The application was developed using Entity Framework Core with a code-first approach and React.

Unregistered users have the opportunity to register on the platform either as freelancers or employers by completing a 5-page registration form.

The application provides interfaces for three types of users: freelancers, employers, and administrators, each with their respective login functionalities. Freelancers can apply for job listings, while employers can post job listings and manage workers, listings, and individual applications. Additionally, users have the ability to update their personal information through the profile section. For more details on the functionalities, please refer to the project itself.
